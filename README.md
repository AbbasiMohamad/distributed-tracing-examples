## Description

This repository is intended to be the exercises of the “**Mastering Distributed Tracing - by Yuri Shkru”** book in **C#/.NET** language.

You can get this wonderful book (Mastering Distributed Tracing: Analyzing performance in microservices and complex systems) from [this address](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-distributed-tracing/9781788628464).  
In the book itself, the exercises are written in Go, Java and Python languages. You can see its GitHub link at [this address](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Distributed-Tracing).

## How to use this repo?

All dependencies are placed in the project files (`.csproj`) as usual. The only external dependency that is needed to run the applications correctly is an instance of the MySQL database along with a bunch of seed data.

```plaintext
$ docker run -d --name mysql56 -p 3306:3306 \
            -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysqlpwd mysql:5.6
            
$ docker exec -i mysql56 mysql -uroot -pmysqlpwd < database.sql
```

the `database.sql` file is at the root of `Chapter04`'s directory.

Of course, you need a tracing backend to see traces on the services. according to the book, I used Jaeger. To run a full functionality instance of Jaeger on your development environment execute following Docker command:

```plaintext
$ docker run -d --name jaeger \
    -p 6831:6831/udp \
    -p 16686:16686 \
    -p 14268:14268 \
    jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.6
```

That's all !
