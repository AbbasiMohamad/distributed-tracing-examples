## Description

This repository is intended to collect examples of distributed tracing that I read in different books or articles.  
I will put the examples of each book or article in its own directory. Also, each book will have its own description in the corresponding directory.

All codes will be in the C#/.NET language.

## Need more information?

For any topic that you think is remarkable, you can create an issue so that we can discuss it. Correcting the code makes me happy in any way; whether it's a pull request or a note on the issue!
